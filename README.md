BioVision
=========

<p>BioVision is an application for analyzing videos for their movement content. Researchers can use this application to automate the data collection process of their experiment. This program handles many complex processes such as video codecs, Microsoft Excel data formatting, and cross platform support; it is being released as an open source project in order to encourage its development and use in the scientific community.</p>
<p>BioVision was designed at the University of Michigan--Dearborn as a Senior Design Project to assist the reasearchers on campus with video analysis. It was commisioned by Dr. Anne Danielson-Francois in September of 2012. Development completed in April of 2013 by Jacob Boncher, Nathaniel Dessert, Dustin Morabito, Joshua Morrison, Daniel Painter, and Molly Pohutski.</p>
<p>It has since become an open source project to which anybody can contribute. The code can be freely modified to be more targeted toward an individual need or improved while staying a general purpose video analyzer.</p>
<p>BioVision uses the <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt Framework</a> and <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV library</a> and is licensed under a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> license.</p>
